<h1>Hey there!</h1>
<hr>
<h2>I'm Aryan, I'm a bit of a rookie when it comes to programming, but I sure am having a great time!</h2>

<h3>Now, if I'm a rookie, why do I have this account?樂</h3>
<p>There's actually many reasons that I have this account. Despite the name, I don't use it to make <i>only</i> discord bots. A lot of my repositories are private since </p>

<ol>
  <li>I don't want people to see the stupid things I did as a noobie JS dev.</li>
  <li>I don't want people taking my work.</li>
  <li>I was too lazy to make them public(probably this one).</li>
</ol>

<p>So far I'm very interested in JS(obviously since I make discord bots), a bit of Java, C#, Kotlin, and now Rust!</p>

<h3>Why am I even interested in these languages if I am a rookie?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Well, JS was the first <i>actual</i> programming language that I learned. Ever since then, I've been using it to create things like discord bots and even my own little webservers/web apps. It's a very flexible language and it will always have a special place in my heart.</li>
  <li>Java, being the second language I learned, has to be another language I'm interested in both because of it's sheer power and the amount of things you can do with it. Whether it be creating Windows Apps, simple CLI programs, simple/complex GUIs, etc. </li>
  <li>C#, although only being something I learned a tiny bit recently, has to be another language like JS, that I will love with all my heart. There is so much you can do with this language, although I am a huge fan of C# and ASP.NET, I'd love to try making some web apps using ASP.NET.</li>
  </li>Now, Kotlin, or as I like to call it, Java but with less steps. I decided to try out this language after seeing it being used in Android App Development. At first, I hadn't understood <i>why</i> people had used Kotlin so widely in this field of programming, but whem I tried it out, I instantly became attatched. Kotlin takes typing strenuous lines of code in Java, and turns them into just a couple of lines that shorten the program and help speed up production. Overall, a language I enjoy and should probably use more. </li>
  <li>And a new member to the list, Rust! I have recently tried out this language in an attempt to create much more powerful webservers, and I must admit, it was very worth it. Its syntax similar to that of C++, its code that shortens long lines of C/C++ code, its power, and so much more. Although I really only use it for making web servers right now, I am planning to use it for much more in the future as it's also a very flexible language.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>That's probably enough for now since I'm writing this at 9:45pm on a school night and should probably go to sleep. My apologies if this was a bit boring to read, I'll probably make it look better when I find the time to 沈.
